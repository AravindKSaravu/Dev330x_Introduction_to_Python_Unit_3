For example, you might want to test whether `5` is an element of the list `[4, 8, 5, 6]`, or you might need to know if a substring `\"or\"` is contained within another string `\"Hello World\"`. It is possible to perform these tests by iterating over the elements of the container (list) and comparing them one by one to the element of interest. However, because this procedure is commonly used, Python has a containment operator (`in`), which can perform this procedure much more efficiently.\n\nNOTE: You can test if an element is NOT contained in another container by using the (`not in`) operator."

You have been using objects; however, you have called them variables and lists. Python saves objects in certain memory locations, knowing the locations is of little importance; however, knowing if two seemingly different objects are at the same memory location is important. This will be critically important when dealing with sequences such as list, tuples, strings, and dictionaries.\n\nIn Python, the concepts of identity and equality are related but not the same, for example:\n* When two objects are saved in the same memory location, they are equal and identical\n* When two objects are saved in different memory locations and contain the same information, they are equal but not identical\n* When two objects are saved in different memory locations and contain different information, they are not equal nor identical\n\nYou can test whether two objects contain the same information using the equality operators `==` or `!=`. To test whether two objects are identical, you need to use the identity operators `is` or `is not`.\n"

You also know that in arithmetic expressions, multiplication has a higher precedence than addition and subtraction. In Python, you can combine different operator types in the same expression (`3 + 1 > 5`); when you do, operator precedence still applies. The following table summarizes operator precedence from lowest precedence to highest precedence. Operators in the same row have the same precedence, and the precedence is resolved from left to right, for example in (`3 * 6 / 9`), `*` and `/` have the same precedence, and Python will perform the multiplication first (`18 / 9`) followed by the division (`2`).\n\n|Operator| Short Description|\n|--------|------------------|\n|or| Boolean or|\n|and| Boolean and|\n|not| Boolean not|\n|in, not in, is , is not, <, <=, >, >=, !=, ==| Containment and identity test, relational comparison|\n|+, -| Arithmetic addition and subtraction|\n|\\*, /, //, % | Arithmetic, multiplication, division, int division, modulo|\n|\\*\\* | Exponentiation|\n|(), [], {}| Parentheses, brackets|\n\nNOTE: When in doubt, use the parentheses operator to control the precedence in an expression"
